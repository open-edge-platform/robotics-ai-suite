# Robotics AI Suite

The **Robotics AI Suite** is a collection of robotics applications, libraries, samples, and benchmarking tools to help you build solutions faster. It includes models and pipelines optimized with the OpenVINO™ toolkit for accelerated performance on Intel® CPUs, integrated GPUs, and NPUs. Refer to the [detailed user guide and documentation](https://developer.robotics.intel.com/development-stack/ai-suite-robotics/).

The **Robotics AI Suite** is organized into **collections** that group workflows and capabilities for different robot categories. Each collection provides:

- Libraries for core robotics workloads and control recipes.
- Integration with ROS 2, supported sensor profiles, and benchmarking tools.
- OpenVINO™-optimised models for computer vision, large language models (LLMs), and vision-language-action (VLA).
- Hardware acceleration on Intel® CPUs, integrated GPUs, and NPUs for faster inference.

The types of collection are as follows:

- **Autonomous Mobile Robot**
  For robots that navigate and operate independently in dynamic environments such as warehouses or factories.
- **Humanoid Robot**
  For robots that learn and replicate human actions to perform interactive or assistive tasks.
- **Stationary Arm**
  For fixed-position robots using vision systems for tasks like inspection, assembly, or quality control.

## Architecture

The diagram below is the single, consolidated view of the Robotics AI Suite. It shows the major software components, how perception, navigation, manipulation, Physical AI, and benchmarking relate, which parts are Intel-provided versus upstream open source, and how workloads map onto Intel® heterogeneous compute (CPU / iGPU / NPU). You should be able to understand what the suite includes — and where Intel adds value — without reading further.

**How to read it**

- Colour tells you ownership: **Intel-provided / optimized** (blue), **ROS 2 / upstream open source** (green), **Intel® silicon** (dark blue), and **user-supplied** robot, sensors, and datasets (grey). A **★** marks Intel value-add over the upstream component.
- The stack is layered top-to-bottom: **developer experience & tooling**, **AI models & pipelines** (OpenVINO™-optimized), **robotics middleware & frameworks** on **ROS 2**, **system software** (real-time kernel, drivers, EtherCAT), and the **Intel® Core™ / Core™ Ultra** hardware. Everything above the hardware line is what you consolidate onto a single Intel platform.

**What you get, and how it fits together**

- **Perception, navigation, and manipulation** are ROS 2 stacks. Intel adds optimized components on top of upstream Nav2, MoveIt, and ORB-SLAM3 — ITS-Planner, FastMapping, Collaborative SLAM, ADBScan, and GroundFloor Segmentation for AMRs; Robot Vision & Control (RVC) and Visual Servoing (CNS) for stationary arms.
- **Physical AI / Embodied models** — VLA (Pi0.5+RTC, RDT-1B), ACT, and Diffusion Policy / iDP3 — plus **LLM / VLM task planning** run through the OpenVINO™ runtime and oneAPI.
- **Benchmarking & tooling** — ROS 2 KPI monitoring, Gazebo simulation, sample applications, and model-optimization / setup tooling — sit in the top developer-experience layer.

**Where Intel accelerates the workload**

Perception and detection run on the **NPU / iGPU**; VLA / diffusion policies and LLM / VLM planning on the **iGPU** (optionally a discrete **Arc™ GPU**); deterministic motion control and planning on the **CPU** with a `PREEMPT_RT` kernel and EtherCAT. OpenVINO™ selects the device per workload, so perception, AI, planning, and real-time control are consolidated on one Intel® platform.

### Runtime data flow

Sensor data flows through perception into the AI decision models, then to planning and real-time control, and out to the actuators — with feedback closing the loop. Each stage is annotated with the compute it targets.

### Workloads mapped to Intel hardware

Each collection uses Intel heterogeneous compute differently. The matrix summarizes the primary (●) and optional (○) compute target for each collection.

## Website

The documentation website combines two tools:
- **Docusaurus (`docs/website/`)** serves as the root site (`/`), providing the landing pages, models catalog, navigation, and theme.
- **Sphinx (`docs/user-guide/`)** builds the in-depth user guide and technical documentation, mounted and served under `/development-stack/`.

Build and serve the complete site locally with:

```bash
make serve
```

`make serve` rebuilds the site with the current `BASE_URL` before serving it, so an earlier preview build cannot leave stale asset paths. Use `make build` (or `make website`) to build without serving. For a PR-style preview:

```bash
BASE_URL=/pr/2/ make serve
```

To serve both versions at once, set a different port for the preview: `BASE_URL=/pr/2/ PORT=3002 make serve`. Each server keeps its own build snapshot, so rebuilding one does not change assets served by the other.

For editing Sphinx documentation directly with live reloading, you can also run `make -C docs serve`.

## Build Targets

The top-level `Makefile` coordinates site and component workflows:

| Target | Description | Status |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `make help` | Print help for all available targets | Active |
| `make website` / `make build` | Build the complete documentation website | Active |
| `make serve` | Build and serve the complete documentation website locally | Active |
| `make build-components` | Build all component packages across `src/` | Placeholder (pending CMake orchestration) |
| `make test` | Run tests across component packages | Placeholder (pending CMake orchestration) |
| `make package` | Package all components (e.g. CPack / Debian packages) | Placeholder (pending CMake orchestration) |

*Note on component targets:* `build-components`, `test`, and `package` are placeholders pending unified CMake orchestration across all packages. See [src/components/README.md](src/components/README.md#building-and-packaging) for current per-component build instructions and future orchestration plans.
